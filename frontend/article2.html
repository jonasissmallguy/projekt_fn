                <h2>The Economic Reality of the World's Poorest</h2>
                <p>Economic inequality and income levels vary dramatically across countries and regions, profoundly affecting people's everyday lives and opportunities. By examining Nepal, South Africa, the USA, and Denmark, we gain insights into how economic development and inequality impact different societies.</p>
            
                <h3>Nepal: Small Steps Towards Equality</h3>
                <p>Nepal is one of the poorest countries in Asia, with a GDP per capita of under $700 in 2017 – a modest increase from about $200 in 1990. Despite this, the Gini coefficient shows a positive trend, falling from about 54 to 48 during the same period. This indicates that resources in the country have become slightly more evenly distributed, although the population still struggles with low incomes and limited opportunities.

                </p>
            
                <h3>South Africa: Wealth Without Equality</h3>
                <p>South Africa has experienced significant economic growth, with GDP per capita reaching over $8,000 in 2011 before falling to around $6,500 in 2017. Despite this growth, South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world, with a Gini coefficient above 63. This extreme inequality is reflected in access to basic necessities such as healthcare, education, and employment for much of the population.

                </p>
            
                <h3>USA: Prosperity with High Inequality</h3>
                <p>The USA has seen impressive economic growth, with GDP per capita rising from $25,000 in 1990 to nearly $60,000 in 2017. Despite this, the country maintains a consistently high Gini coefficient of around 41-42, indicating that wealth is not evenly distributed. Inequality continues to limit opportunities for low-income groups and creates social challenges in an otherwise wealthy nation.

                </p>
            
                <h3>Denmark: Prosperity and Equality</h3>
                <p>Denmark stands as an example of how economic growth can be combined with low inequality. GDP per capita increased from $30,000 in 1990 to over $60,000 in 2017 – comparable to the USA. However, with a Gini coefficient of around 27, Denmark has one of the most equitable income distributions globally. This is due to the country's strong welfare model, which ensures access to healthcare, education, and social benefits for all.

                </p>
            
                <h3>Commonalities and Differences</h3>
                <p>Nepal shows how even small steps towards economic equality can make a difference for the poorest.</p>
                <p>South Africa illustrates how economic growth can occur without improvements in inequality.</p>
                <p>The USA highlights how high prosperity can coexist with high inequality.</p>
                <p>Denmark demonstrates how a strong welfare state can ensure both growth and equality.</p>
            
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Economic data from these four countries reveals how inequality and economic development are interconnected. Nepal and South Africa struggle with different forms of inequality, while the USA and Denmark represent two different paths for wealthy nations. Reducing inequality requires not only economic growth but also targeted policy measures that ensure a more equitable distribution of resources.</p>
