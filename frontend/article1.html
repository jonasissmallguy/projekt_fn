        <h1>Fertility rate</h1>

            <h2>Why Are More Children Born in Some Countries, and How Does This Change Over Time?</h2>
            <p>Birth rates vary dramatically across countries and regions, deeply connected to social, economic, and cultural factors. By examining Burundi, Niger, Bangladesh, and Denmark, we gain a broader perspective on how these factors come into play.</p>
        
            <h3>Burundi: High Fertility as a Survival Strategy</h3>
            <p>Burundi has traditionally had very high fertility rates, with over 7 children per woman in the early 1990s. Although there has been a decline, the fertility rate remains above 5 children per woman.</p>
            <p>High fertility rates in Burundi reflect limited access to healthcare and education, especially for women. Families often choose to have many children as a safeguard against high child mortality. The lack of education for girls and access to contraception remains a significant challenge, preventing further reductions in fertility rates.

            </p>
        
            <h3>Niger: The World's Highest Fertility Rate</h3>
            <p>Niger tops the global list with the highest fertility rate, close to 8 children per woman. This rate has remained remarkably stable over decades, although a slow decline is now visible.</p>
            <p>In Niger, high fertility rates are a result of poverty, cultural norms, and limited access to family planning. Families in Niger often have many children to serve as labor, particularly in rural areas, and as a safety net in case of illness or death. Without investments in women’s education and health, fertility rates are likely to remain high.

            <h3>Bangladesh: A Success Story</h3>
            <p>Bangladesh has been a success story in reducing fertility rates. From over 6 children per woman in the 1980s, the country is now down to fewer than 2.5 children per woman. This outcome is due to extensive investments in education, family planning, and women's rights.</p>
            <p>Unlike Burundi and Niger, Bangladesh demonstrates how access to contraception and awareness of the benefits of smaller families can lead to significant changes. It stands as an example of how targeted policy initiatives can transform a nation's demographic profile.

            <h3>Denmark: Low Fertility and Economic Stability</h3>
            <p>Denmark represents the opposite end of the spectrum. The country has a fertility rate of about 1.7 children per woman – lower than most developing countries but relatively stable compared to other European nations.</p>
            <p>Low fertility in Denmark is due to several factors, including high living costs, delayed family formation, and a focus on careers among women. However, Denmark has managed to avoid the extremely low fertility rates seen in some other European countries, partly due to government support programs such as parental leave and child benefits, which help balance work and family life.

            </p>
        
            <h3>Commonalities and Contrasts</h3>
            <p>Burundi and Niger share high fertility rates, reflecting poverty and a lack of resources. Bangladesh demonstrates how education and health initiatives can dramatically reduce fertility rates. Denmark represents a stable but low fertility rate, where social support systems play a central role.</p>
        
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>These four countries highlight how fertility rates vary across economic and cultural contexts. While Niger and Burundi face challenges related to high fertility, Bangladesh shows how political efforts can lead to improvements. Denmark exemplifies the complex factors shaping fertility in prosperous societies.</p>
            <p>Understanding these dynamics is crucial for finding solutions that support both economic development and sustainable population growth.</p>
