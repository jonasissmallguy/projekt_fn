            <h2>How Have Economic Crises Impacted Inequality Since 1990?</h2>
            <p>Economic crises have consistently had profound effects on inequality, both within and between nations. By examining Thailand, Indonesia, Greece, the USA, and South Africa, we can gain insights into how these shocks have shaped economies and social structures over time.</p>
        
            <h3>Thailand: The Epicenter of the Crisis</h3>
<p>
    Thailand was hit hard by the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The country’s GDP per capita plummeted during the crisis, and although it later regained growth, inequality remained high.
    The Gini coefficient indicates that economic inequality rose as a result of the crisis. The poorest groups experienced massive unemployment and loss of savings, while the most resourceful sectors recovered more quickly.

</p>

        
            <h3>Indonesia: A Slow Recovery</h3>
            <p>Indonesia faced an even deeper crisis than Thailand. From 1997, GDP per capita fell dramatically and took several years to return to pre-crisis levels. Data also shows that the Gini coefficient increased, signaling that inequality grew during the recovery. Many lost their jobs, and access to basic services significantly deteriorated, particularly for the nation’s poorest.

            </p>
        
            <h3>Greece: The Warning Signs</h3>
            <p>Although Greece's major debt crisis erupted after 2008, the country’s economic troubles began in the 2000s. GDP per capita rose up to 2007, but the Gini coefficient reveals a gradual rise in inequality. This demonstrates how economic growth does not always benefit everyone equally and how early signs of strain can signal a looming crisis.

            <h3>USA: A Growing Divide</h3>
            <p>Data from the USA reveals a steady increase in GDP per capita over the period, but the Gini coefficient also shows a consistent rise in inequality. While the country did not experience the same financial shocks as Asia in 1997, the benefits of growth remained concentrated among the highest income groups, while the lowest income groups faced stagnation.

            </p>
        
            <h3>South Africa: Persistent Inequality</h3>
            <p>South Africa, already one of the world’s most unequal nations, saw GDP per capita increase during the period. However, the Gini coefficient remained extremely high, reflecting persistent inequality that economic growth failed to address. For many South Africans, access to opportunities and resources remained limited despite national improvements.

            <h3>Conclusion: A Pattern of Inequality</h3>
            <p>Thailand and Indonesia demonstrate how economic shocks worsen inequality, particularly among the poorest.</p>
            <p>Greece highlights how economic strains can signal larger crises, even in times of growth.</p>
            <p>The USA shows that economic growth does not always equate to reduced inequality and may exacerbate it.</p>
            <p>South Africa confirms that structural inequalities make it challenging to use growth to improve conditions for the poorest.</p>
            <p>Economic crises rarely affect everyone equally. Their consequences often depend on the strength of a society’s social and economic safety nets.</p>
